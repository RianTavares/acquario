This project is part of the [IBM Call for Code 2021](https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/).

## What does it do

This solution helps people discover if their water is potable through image recognition and a questionnaire. According to the volume of non-drinkable water recognized by region, we send these reports to city councilors, Environmental Sanitation Commission, and the company responsible for the water supply.

## Features
- [✓] Easy to use
- [✓] IBM Watson Visual Recognition to identify possible water contamination
- [✓] Developed in React
- [✓] Clean and responsive design thinking on the development of a future mobile app
- [✓] Twitter API to generate warnings about a specific region water contamination at [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/AcquaRioApp).
- [✓] [Deployed at IBM CLOUD](https://acquario-app.mybluemix.net/)
